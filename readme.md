# XISUMA INVENTORY MOD
All od the ideas I'll be writing in this file, came from xisumavoid's youtube video: [Minecraft 1.20 Should Be "The Inventory Update"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJtJ90Vl03M
"Minecraft 1.20 Should Be \"The Inventory Update\"")
## Ideas do implement in this project
1. Add slots for certain miscellaneous items such as: rockets, totem of undying, arrows + enderpearls
2. Every time a block is placed and you have more of it in your inventory, it will replenish the placed blocks
3. A keybind to swich between hotbars
4. The abillity to shift click + drag
5. The abillity to pick block at a distance
6. "Sort Inventory" button
7. Add "Refill" and "Siphon" enchantments to shulekr boxes
8. A place in the inventory just for weapons and tools
9. Stackable items up to 999
10. A way to interact with all GUI blocks in a range of the player
11. Increase the size of the inventory to **nine** hotbars, wich you can see using a slider
> Note: there are *more* ideas in the video that I didn't put in the list, and that's beacuse I just didn't feel like they were vanilla friendly
